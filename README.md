# PartiSim
A simple gravitational particle simulation!

Goal: Try to get the particles to orbit a central star.

Expert mode goal: Try to create a binary or trinary system!

Bro srsly mode: Try to emulate a full (stable!) solar system!

### The Numbers:
*This is based on a VERY simple simulation of Newtonian gravitational forces*
